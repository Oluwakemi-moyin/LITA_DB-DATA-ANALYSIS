### Project Overview
---
Collection and analysis of sales data across the company's various sales regions, markets and stores. The goal of the project is to provide insights into revenue, units sold and transaction category over a two year-period.The analysis focuses on understanding sales performance and revenue trends across various regions and calculating important performance indicators like average revenue and average unit sold per store/region. 
    
### Data Source
---    
Company Sales Data

### Data Collected
---    
This data contains some key columns.
1. Region : The geographical area where each store operates.
2. Market: Market segment/category under the regions
3. Store: Specific locations from which sales data is collated.
4. Unit sold: The number of units sold per transaction.
5. Revenue: The total monetary value generated from each sale.
6. Trade date: The date/time period the sales were made.
7. Model: The product model been sold.
8. Line of business: The business line/category under which the sales falls.
  
### Project Objective  
--- 
This project is to address the following analysis goals.
1. Revenue per Region: Determines the total revenue generated by each region
2. Units sold per Region: Determines the total units sold by each region
3. Average Revenue per Region: shows the average revenue generated by each region to assess performance.
    
### Tools used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download here][sales data.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17345479/sales.data.xlsx)

  1. For Data cleaning,
  2. Analysis and
  3. Visualization
  
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Key Metrics
---
1. Revenue: calculated by multiplying the selling price of each item by the total units sold for the item.
2. Units Sold: Group the data by region and sum the units sold to identify how much each region sold per year/month/day/fiscal period.
3. Average Revenue: It is used to measure the the amount of money a business earns, on average, for each unit of product it sells. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue(TR) a company makes from all its sales by the number of units sold.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
1. Microsoft Excel: used for cleaning the dataset.
2. If function: was used to calculate transaction category using unit sold for each item.
   ```
   Formula: IF($J2<=20, "LOW", IF($J2<=50, "MEDIUM", "HIGH"))
   
4. Pivot Table: Used to summarize the dataset
--
## Revenue by Region

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
--
The use of Pivot table to organize, summarize, and analyze datasets, making it easier to discover patterns and insights in the dataset.
