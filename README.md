Collection and analysis of sales data across the company's various sales regions, markets and stores. The goal of the project is to provide insights into revenue, units sold and transaction category over a two year-period. The analysis focuses on understanding sales performance and revenue trends across various regions and calculating important performance indicators like average revenue and average unit sold per store/region.

This data contains some key columns.
1. Region : The geographical area where each store operates.

### Project Objective  
--- 
This project is to address the following analysis goals.
1. Revenue per Region: Determines the total revenue generated by each region
2. Units sold per Region: Determines the total units sold by each region
3. Average Revenue per Region: shows the average revenue generated by each region to assess performance.
    
### Tools used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download here](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17700021/LITA.Class.Inventory.xlsx)
  1. For Data cleaning
- Power BI [Download here](
  1. Analysis and
  2. Visualization
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Key Metrics
---
1. Revenue: calculated by multiplying the selling price of each item by the total units sold for the item.
2. Units Sold: Group the data by region and sum the units sold to identify how much each region sold per year/month/day/fiscal period.
3. Average Revenue: It is used to measure the amount of money a business earns, on average, for each unit of product it sells. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue(TR) a company makes from all its sales by the number of units sold.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
1. Microsoft Excel: used for cleaning the dataset.
2. If function: was used to calculate transaction category using unit sold for each item.
   ```
   Formula: IF($J2<=20, "LOW", IF($J2<=50, "MEDIUM", "HIGH"))
   ```
3. Power BI :
   - for Summarisation of the dataset and
   - for Visualisations.
4. DAX functions :
   - Calculated Columns. e.g Monthly trade date
   ```
   Formula: 'Sheet1 (2)'[Trade Date].[Month]
   ```
   - Calculated Measure e.g Target
   ```
   Formula: 1,000,000,000
   ```

   - In 2014, the Company's total revenue was 4746.46% more than the Target of 1billion usd for the year.  It met the target and exceeded by 2356.74% in Year 2015.
4. Strategic Implication
   - The company generates more Revenue from the Service Plan compared to other line of businesses.
   - Printer sales generated the lowest total revenue.
   - The Top two best regions where the company generates the most revenue are North East and South West.
   - The lowest performing region is the North Central.
   - Data for Year 2015 is not complete, as we only have record of January to June so we cannot make concrete conclusion about the year's performance compared to Year 2014.
   
### Conclusion
---
These are my recommendations;
1. The Company should focus on ways of generating more sales from the Service plan since that is the best performing plan. More Sales will lead to greater Revenue for the 
   Company. These could be through Sales Promos, Discounts,etc.
2. Implementation of ways to increase sales in the North Central region which can help boost the region's total revenue.
3. The company needs to decide if Printer sales as a line of business is profitable to the company and if it is worth continuing, as it brought in the lowest revenue in both 
   years in review.

4. Strategic Implication
   - Although Parts has the bulk of total sales, overall, it still has a much lower contribution to total revenue compared to Service plan.
   - This could be as a result of lower prices for PARTS compared to SERVICE PLAN.

### Conclusion
---
1. The company should introduce January special sales with lower prices to increase total sales in that period going forward. As a higher total sales leads to higher revenue for 
   the company.
2. There should be a price review for PARTS. Higher prices will lead to higher total Revenue.
