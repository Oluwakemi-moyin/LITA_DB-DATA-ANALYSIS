### Tools used
---
- Microsoft Excel [Download here]([LITA Class Inventory.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/17700021/LITA.Class.Inventory.xlsx))
  1. For Data cleaning
- Power BI [Download here](
  1. Analysis and
  2. Visualization
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Key Metrics
---
1. Revenue: calculated by multiplying the selling price of each item by the total units sold for the item.
2. Units Sold: Group the data by region and sum the units sold to identify how much each region sold per year/month/day/fiscal period.
3. Average Revenue: It is used to measure the amount of money a business earns, on average, for each unit of product it sells. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue(TR) a company makes from all its sales by the number of units sold.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
1. Microsoft Excel: used for cleaning the dataset.
2. If function: was used to calculate transaction category using unit sold for each item.
   ```
   Formula: IF($J2<=20, "LOW", IF($J2<=50, "MEDIUM", "HIGH"))
   ```
3. Power BI :
   - for Summarisation of the dataset and
   - for Visualisations.
